In this mini project, I tried to incorporate several 
different skills and techniques I have learnt, in
order to create a solution. This projects first began as 
a project to create an automated tinderbot, I didn't have
a facebook account so I decided to not go through with it
since I already created a project which interacted with 
a web browser. I thought of using google API to retrieve a 
list of hyperlinks for me to then go and interact with internet speed
programs. Naturally, I checked to see if there were APIs that already performed 
this, but I wanted to do this using a web browser automator.

This program makes five requests to the website 'https://speedtest.net'
saving each download and upload speed. The program then returns the average
for the two metrics, this has been turned into a system service that can be called
on the command line as a command.
